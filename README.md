# Using satellite and street level images to predict urban emissions

## Description

## Code structure


* In "imagery" we find the scripts to retrieve satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine (`imagery/getting_imagery_no_mask.py`) and the street level images from Google Street View (training set is build with `imagery/get_street_imagery_train_set.py` and .... )





Note: Model training code has been largely adapted from Stanford CS 230's Computer Vision project code examples at https://github.com/cs230-stanford/cs230-code-examples
